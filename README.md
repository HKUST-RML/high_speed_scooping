# High-Speed Scooping

## 1. Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **High-Speed Scooping**, which refers to the task of picking up thin objects rapidly by interacting with the environment through a direct-driven gripper. The task of high-speed scooping addresses the limitation of [**Smack and Snatch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnHtb0XP3U4&ab_channel=ManipulationLab), which is unstable for picking up relatively thin objects, for example, plastic cards.
